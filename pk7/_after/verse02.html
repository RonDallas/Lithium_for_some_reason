<p>I uh, haven't posted on Tmblr for, what, 7 years? It's felt like longer, and also shorter. It always feels like five years ago you were a different person, and then you realize you're not even the same <em>kind</em> of person you were then. "No, I'm not conservative anymore, I'm 27, not 21! Yeah, in five years I'll be just the way I am right now. I'm at the azimuth of self-actualization! No more changes from here on."</p>
<p>In the time since the Hell Incident, I've been thinking about gender a lot. Yeah, you know where I'm going with this already, but just hear me out. It's been, what, over two fucking thousand years since queer liberation? It took them hundreds of years after the "Second Coming of the Roaring Twenties," just like people with skin differences were. Yes, I <em>have</em> been reading into history and <em>none</em> of you can stop me from dumping every thought I have onto a website barely anyone even pays attention to anymore.</p>
<p>Yes, <em>them</em>, the <em>queers</em>. I'm not like that. Straight edge straight man I am. At least queer people don't get randomly killed anymore, but we're a thousand years into reform over reform and I'm starting to think I'm losing my religion. After all, I did go to <em>Hell</em>! Ha ha ha.</p>
<p>At least corporations are rigidly controlled by the Federation. At least people with disabilities get exemptions. At least we aren't the kind of people we were 2600 years ago. There's a lot I learned from history that came hitting me in the face right here in the present. I wish I had seen it sooner in myself. I'm too old to get government support for transitioning. I'm 34 in a few months. The subsidiary keeping me afloat dispersed when the province government found them laundering more money than I could ever comprehend existing.</p>
<p>I know I'm putting way more info about myself online than I should. It's fine, just keep reading. Anyways. I'm not even close to broke, wouldn't be for my whole natural life, but also, I've got no income. I'm not visibly disabled, so I should be working. Not a veteran, too dangerous for that. Trauma's a bitch, but I've already argued in court to no avail that it's too much of a bitch for me to hold a job. So now I'm stuck here, a woman, with only enough money for, what, 10 years on hormone therapy? If I don't spend any of it, y'know, eating. Can't work, but can't get any kind of benefit that would let me keep going. I'm an honorary criminal.</p>
<p>My partner passed away last month. I'd been with them for 3 years. About as long as I knew I was queer. My parents and their parents took the last few years to all die. Nobody to pass on my blood, I've never been interested. So many of my friends are gone.</p>
<p>I am going to kill myself. Right now, I'm scared. I know this feeling will not pass, I know that I'm stuck in a hole, I know I could probably get out if I tried. I'm losing my fucking mind because everyone around me is dying and I am not the person I was 5 years ago. <em>I am not the person I was five years ago.</em></p>

<p>I'm still awake.</p>
<p>I'm not really sure why.</p>
<p>I reach back to the darkness I felt years ago, when I had nothing. When it was all taken from me. I resent all the people that brought me here. I resent how much I hurt myself. I kept living. I needed to. So I had to keep feeling that I was alive.</p>
<p>I'm lost within myself. So I reach back into the dark. It doesn't let go. Into the pit! Into the pit!</p>
<p>Every time I spiral these days all I can think is how much of a farce it is. It's like my mind just wants me to never be happy. I'm lying here in bed, just fine, wanting to fucking kill myself. Ostensibly nothing is wrong. I can pick myself up, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fuck this. I'm getting up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I get up. I go to the kitchen. I don't know what time it is anymore. I look at the clock, but it just looks like random shapes. I've got my pack of cigarettes, smoking them one after the other. It's really dark in here. Each one I put out on myself. I keep thinking of Min. I really do wonder what time it is at this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After a seemingly infinite set of cigarettes, I realize I'm out. Looks like this was a fresh pack, too. Weird. Don't remember opening one. Whatever.</p>
<p>I look at the clock. It's 5 in the morning. Kinda wonder when Rick is gonna wake up.</p>

<p>Hey y'all, I'm sorry for the post I made 2 days ago. I deleted it. I spent yesterday in a hospital. My landlord saw my whole spiral and thought I was insane, so he called the cops on me. I hurt myself a lot. My skin is deformed from burns, more so than normal for someone who went to war. I get really high to try and dull the pain. I keep doing it. Nobody noticed. Not until I went and said how I felt.</p>
<p>Ultimately none of this really matters. I hurt myself and I hope someone will reach out and help me, but I'm just deeper in this pit still. I get high to pass my time and hope something will change. I'm stuck in the cracks.</p>

<p>Didn't think I'd ever be in a hotel again. Places like this are where my kind always end up. It's all I deserve. Not like I can say that for the kid that got kicked out of zir house for being queer living next to me. Maybe for the skin-head on the other side of the building, but I don't think he even deserves a place as safe as this.</p>
<p>... Mmm. At least I'm not that guy, I guess. Being me isn't much better though.</p>
<p>I imagine one day I'll have my head caved in the vending machine out front. Probably thanks to that guy.</p>

<p>Half a year is a long time, it feels like.</p>
<p>It's been a while since I was put in the hospital. Even longer since I was in the hospital for my debrief and equipment removal. It's been 5 months since I met Jeremy, and a week since we became partners. He came to me after someone who used to run OFMD notified him that I existed. This guy, Quinton, was apparently aware of AOF's operations in Hell and tracked Jeremy throughout his escape before me. Part of the reason the company collapsed. He... saw what I wrote, and arranged to find Jeremy.</p>
<p>I'm still confused. My outlook on life hasn't really changed, but I at least know that I'm safe in the world now. I'm cared for. Even if I was to dip into a gutter I would be pulled back up. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>I'm awake in my bed. Jem is beside me, still sleeping. What I saw couldn't have been a dream, though. What I saw was my entire life played out, but everything was just a bit different. Jem looked a bit strange. His hair was the wrong color. The color of our bedroom was different. I saw past what happens right now, in this moment, in my bed. It's not what's happening now, but similar to it. I wonder how long it'll take for these to desynchronize completely. I go back to bed. I dream normally.</p>

<code>AUTHOR: Lane Blazkowicz-Stilko, Operations Overseer</code><br>
<code>DESCRIPTION:</code></p>
<p>Today begins the first day of operation of the Nue-Vaeta. All crew have embarked and have begun preparations for launch. The matter-fold drive is not currently operational, but all other systems are online.</p>
<p>Our voyage shall take precisely two years. We have arranged for all days of celebration to be free and allotted around half of every week to working. Our mission is to chart our entire sector and submit the data to the Federation archives for public use. There are many inhabited planets around here, and many of them are currently part of the Neo-Communist Coalition, so no Federation ship has come close in fear of looking like a spy vessel.</p>
<p>While we are dismayed at the conspiratorial thinking of the Federation, we here on Delsona have wanted to learn more about our sector for a long time. Our second chance to explore our part of the galaxy has come. We shall chart our stars without their help.</p>
<p><em>Let's see what's out there. -Lane</em></p>

<p>I let out a small sigh. An exciting first step has just been made. "It's really a shame the Federation wouldn't send us, I don't know, anything to help with this survey.

<p><code>MISSION LOG: 1682N-12-13-1800</code><br>
<code>AUTHOR: Jeremy Blazkowicz-Stilko, Chief of Sciences</code><br>
<code>DESCRIPTION:</code></p>
<p>Today we had a strange security issue. Lane and I were in the laboratory studying some rocks from our survey on a currently un-named planet. We found bacteria locked away within these stones like a nest of bees in amber. Not a big deal, no containment breach occurred. We scanned the bacteria, and it was harmless. The computer, however, did not like it. Something about the scanned bacteria had accidentally triggered a cascading systems failure, and the room went dark.</p>
<p>We investigated. It was an out-of-bounds error in one of the data read-out subprocesses, a very particular edge case. I was considering just leaving it as-is, but I decided to fix the error in case it happens in the future. Then I checked the m-time for the subprocess. Yesterday. <em>Someone</em> had tampered with this system so that it would cause a cascading failure.</p>
<p>Obviously, I was angry. Someone aboard must be trying to sabotage our survey efforts. I had guessed that it would be someone secretly from the Federation. Prepared to figure out the truth, I went to Lane for guidance.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It was me. I did it. I completely forgot, because I was, to put it lightly, blasted. Around 22:00 yesterday, Lane and I were in our bedroom, her playing video games, and me watching, and we were very, very stoned. She remembers the whole thing, apparently. I had to piss. I went off to the bathroom, but something caught my eye. I apparently forgot to stop what I was doing on my computer and shut it down earlier. Naturally, the thing that caught my eye was that on my screen was a bunch of <em>dicks</em>. I apparently got all of these out to practice drawing with. Drawing dicks. I'm not sure how stoned I was when I got off my computer, but it must have been pretty dire.</p>
<p>Apparently, she saw me on there for... hours. I was doing <em>something</em> to the scanner. I believe, from the evidence I have gathered, that I was trying to create a 2D display with the scanner's beams. No idea why. I touched the data read-out code in the process of creating this effect, perhaps thinking it might have to be changed to accommodate. In my stupor, I must have undone these changes, and changed the code to look more correct than before.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this 2D display idea is actually not possible. Unless I install a quantum processor into this thing, it's not going to get the timing resolution needed. I've stored the experiment in a diff file for future use.</p>

<code>AUTHOR: Lane Stanley Blazkowicz-Stilko, Operations Overseer</code><br>
<code>DESCRIPTION:</code></p>
<p>It's been two years since our exploration of this sector began on the Nue-Vaeta. Today, we head back to Delsona, having charted every system and object here. While this has been discussed thoroughly in our communal negotiation sessions, I shall summarize our final decision on how to proceed with our collected data, paraphrased from said sessions' transcriptions:</p>
<p>"We have decided, collectively, to <strong>rescind</strong> our original stated mission of delivering our charting data to the Federation. We will rescind this statement due to the ongoing war between the Federation and the Coalition. Besides the clear violation of treaties, besides the clear evidence of warcrimes committed, and even besides the fact that <em>all</em> inhabited planets in this sector - including our own - are part of the Coalition, we have decided that potential strategic information being released to public channels in wartime is not of any benefit to us and could even compromise our friends."</p>
<p>Thankfully, not everything sucks. We'll keep our charting data on a need-to-know basis within the Coalition, and we can strategize in silence <em>before</em> the cops come to visit. Despite our mission not getting quite the result we first intended from it, we are all celebrating the fruits of our hard work.</p>

Nobody could figure it out. We'd watch garbage old shows from the dark ages together. We'd watch old Delsonan movies from our childhood.
