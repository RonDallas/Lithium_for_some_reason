@@ \#INFO_DESCR_HeadsUpDisp
This is a military issue Heads Up Display program, which tracks vital signs,
munitions, armor status, and more with numeric signifiers.

Originally designed by a former video game designer, a great amount of effort
had to be put into fine-tuning this program to tell you exactly when you're
about to die, your armor is about to break and get you killed, or you're about
to run out of ammunition, and then die.

@@ \#INFO_DESCR_JetBooster
These are standard jet boots produced by OFMD, upgraded for private use. They
have a safety lock which deactivates while the user is mid-air so they don't
backfire and burn your heels. Keeps the user smoothly held in air with a
stabilizer chassis attached to the leg, so your natural instinct to screw it
up is canceled out.

Powered with a small energy cell about the size of your Calcaneus that can
stay stable mid-air for approximately 7 months without fail.

Press "jump" after a double-jump to activate.

Software for your Computer/Brain Interface that improves your ability to move,

This software has been deemed vital to your mission, and has been provided to
you with yet more upgrades.

You can jump while mid-air by pressing "jump" again, hurtling your body
upwards with sheer force.

You can also now slide in any direction with ease by pressing "run".

Newer versions of this program have a backdoor built into them. This old

An update for your reflex wetware developed while you were being deployed on
your mission. Improves your jump height and speed.

Also grants you a new ability: While you're falling, your legs will
automatically extend in a fashion that attacks anything below it. The higher
the fall, the greater the impact.

Couldn't be deployed initially to you due to complications in shipping to a
combat zone.

@@ \#INFO_DESCR_Yh0
Developed by avians of the planet Durla Prime, this armor plating is able to
mitigate damage of one type almost completely for an indefinite amount of time.

This plating uses a set of unique systems that can each block one kind of
attack with extreme prejudice, but due to allowing full control of the
plating to each system, can only use one at a time.

Works over your currently equipped armor, so damage from even rockets may be
lowered into what feels like a small tickle.

A rather brute upgrade that gathers wasted adrenaline from your body
and injects it back into you all at once when you're in danger.

This gives the effect of time stopping for a moment as you move with
extreme swiftness, triggered by proximity to projectiles and being
targeted by enemies.

Using this without losing your mind or otherwise passing out requires
intense training given only to military forces.

The 44th method of the \chCaeruleum\c- mode, this rather complex attack must
be applied passively. It siphons power from the recently deceased and releases
it into a ball of metaphysical attack energy.

The exact origin of this method is debated, and it is not in common use due to
its strange circumstances and the general requirement of strong, plentiful
opponents to be useful in combat.
