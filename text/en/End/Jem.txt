%% LITHEND_Normal_1_Jem
In the beginning, you felt comfort.

Comfort of yourself and your home.

The allowances of personal will, of sanctity -

But so soon was it ripped away, your life in twain.

Who you needed to be and who you wanted to be.

The sanctity you felt so long ago was just a facade,
so incredibly thin,
the world so incredibly harsh.

So incredibly harsh, and so incapable of holding you.

When Delsona was taken by AOF, you cried. In this moment,
you feel those same tears coming back to you.

Tears you wished for for decades.

Tears you prayed for.

Tears for the lost, the destroyed, the unneeded.

Tears to save them the burden.

%% LITHEND_Normal_2_Jem
It was worse than a nightmare. Every person in your prefecture,
taken, enslaved, killed.

One by one.


You feel their pain,


all of it,



and you cry.

AOF took your humanity. Your sanity. Everything, from you.

Your friends.

Your parents.

Your town.

Your prefecture.

Delsona.

Your world.

You feel the pain of it all, and you cry harder.

%% LITHEND_Normal_3_Jem
So much suffering and loss,

        for what?


Power. So much of it.


Overwhelming control over the lives of thousands,

and seeking only more.


Just like the demons.


But... Somehow, worse.


Somehow, an evil so pure,


                even the incarnation of evil


       would not stand up to it.

AOF took so much from you, even your identity. Unlike most like you,
they couldn't give you another name. Jeremy was always your name.

This was the only mercy given.

Despite your name, body, appearance, everything; you still were
treated as if you had never decided to be a man. Why?

Compliance is their only goal. What you want and work for do not
matter here. Only that you will fight to the death for them.

But along the way, as you suffered your entombment, you learned that
you were not alone.

Zeke was the first to approach you. Ready to die, he pleaded to you
for the mercy of death. He knew quite well you couldn't. Your
compassion for him knew no bounds, with no way to express it.

Eventually, Zeke introduced you to another friend. Daniel. The most
wonderful person you ever met. Radiant with love, just like you. A
woman the AOF would not accept.

Even though they were able to tell you names they prefered, they
weren't allowed to use them. Nor were you.

Zeke's sanctioned name was Jacques, from before he changed it to
escape his family.

Daniel's was, of all things, Cade. She never let you speak that name
around her, so you always used ambiguity to refer to her.

@@ LITHEND_Normal_5_Jem
The two had more in mind than just being friends with you, though.

In a matter of weeks, the Deceiver movement began. Michael taught the
seven of you how to fight back. Not with weapons, but with code.

Zeke spearheaded the firmware hacks.

Solomon, a higher-up realizing his potential to escape, masterminded
the operation.

Samuel and Josh mused forever about how best to destroy AOF after we
were free.

Finally, you were once again alive. Even if you could not see
yourself, you were alive. Ready to fight.

@@ LITHEND_Normal_6_Jem
And in the time it took for you to come to terms with yourself,

so did the others.

Samuel and Josh vowed not only to destroy AOF, but to be together for
the rest of their days after this was over.

Solomon wanted nothing but repentance. It took a lot to get here, and
a lot of sacrifice of others.

Zeke wanted nothing more but to live. Finally, he had accepted life
over death.

Michael knew he could help others just like he had here, and vowed to
commit his life to doing so.

Daniel wanted to live with you, and to become your partner. She had
never met someone like her before, much less someone from a place so
accepting.

%% LITHEND_Normal_7_Jem
Years of planning led up to this moment.

Years of tarnish and despair.


But there were times of happiness, however small.


Your award for this effort is but more despair.



    So much sacrifice, but your sanity has returned.


          So much suffering, but you are free.



                 So much death, but \cgyou\c- are free.

@@ LITHEND_Normal_8_Jem
You finish crying. The amount of fluid coming out of your face is
greater than the amount of fluid that has come out of your body since
you were enslaved a millionfold.

It's over, and you can feel your senses coming back to you. You think
to yourself, for once. But only sad thoughts come — What happened to
the others? Will I ever know?

Perhaps some truths are better left unknown.

You look around you. You see a familiar scene. A terrifying one. Yet,
a happy one. You are in your home town. Burned down and barren, but
still exactly as it was so many decades ago.

Nobody is here.

Yet, you feel their spirits. You feel the pulse of the planet coursing
throughout your body once more. The feeling of true freedom. The
freedom of movement, and to be what you wish.

There are still star-ships here. Entire warehouses untouched. Never
bothered to be pillaged. Perhaps it's time to build a new home. Become
the proud man you always wished to be.

%% LITHEND_Normal_9_Jem
\cdAnd so, you are at last free.
\cdFree again to think and observe, and see for yourself
\cdthe abolishment of your former captors.

\cnNo more distrust of your will.

\cnFor this sake, this is only the beginning.


\ctBut for the ones you replaced, and the ones you mourn,
\ct        for yourself,

\crthis is merely an end.

\czPerhaps one day you will forgive yourself for
\czwhat you have sacrificed, but today that is no matter.

\cvToday is the beginning. The beginning of life once again.
\cvYour parents are waiting back at home.

\cvIt's time to go back.
