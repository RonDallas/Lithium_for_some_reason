"Consciousness starts abrupt." Trapped within another self, a shallow
prison pit, trapped within the darkness. The ball of anger tries to
free itself, thrashing, thrashing around, lest it become impotent, it
blinds the wretch without.

\c[Lith_Blue]Walk into another game, seeking for yourself feelings of blame.
\c[Lith_Pink]I walk downwards another path, hoping only that it leads back.
\c[Lith_Blue]A dark place leads to a dark mind, a life you will never handle,
\c[Lith_Pink]you sought out sanctity, hoping to escape from it all.
\c[Lith_Blue]The snow outside feels like death.
\c[Lith_Pink]The cold can do nothing to me except,
\c[Lith_Blue]tidal volume increasing pace,
\c[Lith_Pink]please just let me leave this place.
\c[Lith_Blue]Please let me leave this place...
\c[Lith_Pink]Hours pass, nothing yet.

\c-A drop of light descends from above, in a haze you try to grasp at
it. Thrashing comes from within, and your eyes go blank. Your grip on
it slips for a moment, but still, the light speaks to you. In your
left ear it whispers a promise of care. In your right ear it whispers
a promise of undoubted return. Then, it fades away.

Hours pass, you sit there. Days pass, still the thrashing from within
taunts you. It tells you to end this. You do not listen. It kicks at
its cage. You, too, kick at yours. It tries to break free, but you
crush it down. It speaks through your voice, but you are the only one
talking. Months pass, yet still no sign of the light.

You leave the frigid wastes. Today, you are broken. The thrashing
continues, but you move on. You walk upwards, leading back to where
you began. You lay down in a bed of flowers, and the anger leaves your
body. All you can feel, now, is regret.

You wake up, drenched in sweat. The dream may have been abstract, but
it felt exactly like your first memory.

Looking back on these memories, you start to wonder what's real. Your
body and mind feel at odds with each other. Your mind and your
memories, even moreso. A dialogue begins, trying to reconcile these
things.

"\c[Lith_Pink]Feel around your body. Close your eyes and focus on
every detail of it.\c-" You feel around, yet nothing is amiss.
"\c[Lith_Blue]I am as I am.\c-"

"\c[Lith_Pink]Do you remember who you are?\c-" You are Aricil
Deyan'za, brother of Omisielle Faulzaje, Dark Lord of the House of
Next Dawn. "\c[Lith_Blue]I am who I am.\c-"

"\c[Lith_Pink]Do you remember where you came from?\c-" Another
universe, another time-scale, another story. You were born of the same
mother as Omi, but separated at birth. Your childhood feels hazy. All
you can remember is waking up in a room...

\c[Lith_Blue]A room? \c[Lith_Pink]Was there anything before that?
\c[Lith_Blue]There had to have been, but that seems like the wrong
question. \c[Lith_Pink]Was there a bed? \c[Lith_Blue]Of some kind. I
remember waking up and not breathing. \c[Lith_Pink]There was something
odd, no? \c[Lith_Blue]The building, I just walked out. With you.
\c[Lith_Pink]I don't remember being there. \c[Lith_Blue]Do you
remember the snow on the ground?

\c[Lith_Pink]Yes. \c[Lith_Blue]It was like a nightmare. The whole
world was frozen over, and neither of us could remember our names.
\c[Lith_Pink]Yes. \c[Lith_Blue]An operation... \c[Lith_Pink]Yes.

Thus did the giant crush and bludgeon the barrier of the irreal,
destroying all the wicked in his path. They lay now again in a bed of
flowers, sight drenched in light. A blink of an eye brings them upon a
throne. The giant and the wretch within seal their blade in its
backrest. No monarchs by them would be made.

The swath of darkness no longer was able to make its way outside its
self. Soon, everything would collapse. The giant felt horrible, like
he had broken a promise.

But the wretch within said to them, "\c[Lith_Pink]My certain demise
comforts me, brother. With me will you die, by my misstep. Power I
sought, but look at us now. Your care for me brought me here. Yet so I
will die alone with you, and my thoughts, for comfort.\c-"

The giant was with pause, and replied: "\c[Lith_Blue]Power you sought,
but power absolute you gained. This plane is still yet without mercy.
Its ingress is stopped, but inside we lay as its yolk. If I may,
sister, dare ask this: Will you only give in and bear its burden?\c-"

So did they fight on through eternity, stretched infinitely inward to
the point of the next and last relay. Every last piece of matter
within the plane they dwelt in was destroyed. Every last throne was
defaced, and every living being killed. There was absolutely nothing
left but the twins, who were untied at birth.

\c[Lith_Pink]It's clear to me now. Do you remember where we were?

\c[Lith_Blue]AOF...

\caA body that lies only in the depths of your mind.
\caMerged together, somehow,
\cayou feel like the world wasn't meant for you to live in.

\ckA world too broken, or the fault of individuals?
\ciSomething more, a repartee of death -
\cgthe sickness of the heart of those in power.

\cfA distrust so ingrained, intents no longer matter.
\cgA death of self, a death of conviction -
\cnnow our time here has come to an end.

\cxA hope to regain what was taken. A hope to see closure.
\cyHopes turn into dreams. Dreams turn into reality.
\ctAnother time awaits.

\cbWe became like the light of the universe,
\cbeventually becoming nothingness, and evaporating.

\cnLeft alone, the yolk became something new.
\ctAnother time became, but still the cycle repeats -

\cwThe story of the two tied at rebirth,
\cdwill yet once more close.
