%% LITHEND_Normal_1_Ari
Waves of light scatter and permeate,
during these last few moments
before death sweeps and parts us,
at least hold my hand.

Yet, at the same time,
something nags at the back of your mind.
Like a truck, the wave crashes into you.

One last silent hit,
and you've left this place.

The only thing left is yourself.


No more.


You can't hold on to pretty pictures.

@@ LITHEND_Normal_2_Ari
\cn+ You wake up in a field of green grass. The sky is blue. You sit
there, wondering what you might have just seen. You look into the
distance. You see your home city.\c-

\cn+ It's burning.\c-

   \cmWas this the result of your stunt?
  \cmDid you cause this?
 \cmIs it your fault?
\cmDid you?
@@

\ca- No. Above are space ships, bearing the mark of the moon. This is
simply the end.\c-

The war has started.

%% LITHEND_Normal_3_Ari
\caA body in the depths of your mind.
\caYou feel like the world wasn't meant
\cafor you both to live in.

\cnSecondarily, a fabrication of self,
\cnsheared through exosymbol

\ckA broken world, or faulty individuals?
\ciSomething more, a repartee of death -
\cga sickness of the heart, everywhere.

\cxA hope to regain what was taken.
\cxA hope to see closure.
\cyHopes turn into dreams.
\cyDreams turn into reality.
\ctAnother time awaits.

\cwThe story of the two tied at rebirth,
\cdhas yet once more closed.
