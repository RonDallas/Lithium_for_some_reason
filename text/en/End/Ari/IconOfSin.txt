Thus did the giant crush and bludgeon the barrier of the irreal,
destroying all the wicked in his path. They lay in a bed of flowers,
sight drenched in light. A blink of an eye brings them upon a throne.
The giant and the wretch within seal their blade within its backrest.
No monarchs by them would be made.

The swath of darkness no longer was able to make its way outside its
self. Soon, everything would collapse. The giant felt horrible, like
he had broken a promise.

But the wretch within said to them, "\c[Lith_Pink]My certain demise
comforts me, brother. With me will you die, by my misstep. Power I
sought, but look at us now. Your care for me brought me here. Yet so I
will die alone with you, and my thoughts, for comfort.\c-"

The giant was with pause, and replied: "\c[Lith_Blue]Power you sought,
but power absolute you gained. This plane is still yet without mercy.
Its ingress is stopped, but inside we lay as its yolk. If I may,
sister, dare ask this: Will you only give in and bear its burden?\c-"

So did they fight on through eternity, stretched infinitely inward to
the point of the next and last relay. Every last piece of matter
within the plane they dwelt in was destroyed. Every last throne was
defaced, and every living being killed. There was absolutely nothing
left but the twins, who were untied at birth.

They became like the light of the universe, eventually becoming
nothingness and evaporating. Left alone the yolk became something new.

\cwblades bring death —
\coyour life like a blade —
\cgalive and yet,


\cnto inform your self, see clearer,
\cnin morning dawn, three more.


\ctLiving in hell is like every day,
\cvthen yet you stay by my side like a dog,
like a dog, whimpering,
whimpering, and yet,
\cmmay i have a break?
\cmchild i may be.


\cxThe cycle goes on, so far uninterrupted.
\ciBlades seek me out,
        \ciI cherish
      \citheir brevity.


\cdOn instinct, I dwell,
   \cdso undenied, I stay.


  \caRepeat, repeat, repeat again —
   \cgblades speak truths we
    \cofail to say ourselves.
