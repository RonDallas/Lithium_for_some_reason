Direction, direction, splitting and falling, it's always got something
to do with distance. Distance increases led to atrophy, distance
decreases led to sinusoidal collapse looping hysteresis. Direction
towards what? What are you looking for? Why are you trying to—stuck
again. Again and again and it keeps on going—Do you think this is
funny?—Was it okay when it happened? Will it matter, by your end, that

operation was canceled a month ago. Blazkowicz, their point man,

happened was me being assigned "missing in action" after the fact!

more than shenanigans going on here.]
