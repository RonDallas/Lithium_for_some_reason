Direction, direction, splitting and falling, it's always got something
to do with distance. Distance increases led to atrophy, distance
decreases led to sinusoidal collapse looping hysteresis. Direction
towards what? What are you looking for? Why are you trying to—stuck
again. Again and again and it keeps on going—Do you think this is
funny?—Was it okay when it happened? Will it matter, by your end, that
it was done to you?—Reiterating. Looping. No more distance.

What were you to be, lost one?
I wish I could feel, now, to reach out and
         feel what I lost.
Why must my cold body be unjust, for sake of myself?
Living here keeps me
                   lost in just what?
I leave heart open to myself, so then closed off
from my eyes, foolish me
       seeing open doors in a mind long deserted.
Please, go. Leave me alone.

First layer, middle, but what's next is beneath;
