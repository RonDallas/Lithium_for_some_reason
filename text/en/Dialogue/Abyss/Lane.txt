I will walk, with my shadow flag...

Oh, hello there. Apologies!

Hello.

Ah, hey there. You look familiar.
\cq[Who is she?]

Oh, sorry, didn't mean to bother you.

Oh, sorry, didn't mean to bother you.

Oh, do I? How so, might I ask? I don't believe I've met you before.

\cn[I feel intimidated by this doll.]

%% LITHABYS_lane_m_meet_o0
No, it must be nothing.
\cq[I'm sure it's nothing.]

No, just forget about it, sorry.

No, I've definitely seen you.

@@ LITHABYS_lane_m_nothing_0
Hmm... Well, whatever. Say, do you like RPG games? Also, where exactly
are we? I feel like I know *you*...

me this hard to follow.]

@@ LITHABYS_lane_m_nothing_1
Don't you hate it when they make you grind to get a 100% run? It's
just kind of mean to do that. Why not just make hidden areas?

\cn[I'm kind of perplexed. I did just finish a 100% run of an RPG
recently, and I did end up thinking that. Weird.]

\c-Anyways!

@@ LITHABYS_lane_m_nothing_2
Strange! Were you passing into Hell, by chance? I think we might be in
some kind of precipice - a dream, perhaps!

\cn[She's surprisingly happy about this revelation.]

%% LITHABYS_lane_m_nothing_o0
I do like RPG games. Why?
\ct[Probably best to ignore the rest for now.]

%% LITHABYS_lane_m_nothing_o1
I'm not sure where we are. I just... woke up here.
\ct[I'm probably in Hell.]

Why *do* we think we look alike, anyhow?

Nevermind, you talk a mile a minute.

Hmm... Do you happen to have scars on your upper arms?

No.

Ah, hey there.

Hey, you're making a weird face! Are you coming onto me? I've got a
partner! Wait, he looks just like you!

hell am I thinking? It's just a doll.]

%% LITHABYS_lane_c_meet_o0
You just reminded me of someone.

I don't think any of this is real. Maybe I'm dead.

And you remind me of someone! Maybe we're onto something. Sorry for
the misunderstanding!! I wish I could read the room better. Did you
see anyone else pass through here? It's just been me...

\cn[Who is she? Definitely not Daniel.]

There seem to be other dolls around here.

Dolls? What do you mean, other ones?

Er, I mean, I just saw one a bit ago. Where do you think we are?

Er, let me go... find them. I'll be right back.

I don't know, honestly. I remember going to sleep, and then... Ah! Am
I dreaming? That would be pretty likely. But you seem pretty real to
me... Ah! You must be my imagination of Jem. I know him pretty well!
But, dang, you look really beat up. Are you okay?

Oh! You're Jem from the past! How did you get here??? I didn't meet
you back then! I'm supposed to be dreaming!!

Well, we both appear to be sentient, and awake. Time... shenanigans?

Sounds about right, I think. Maybe I won't even remember this... Maybe
this never happened at all! Ah, well. Jemmy and Laney... Hey, do you
remember what happened in 1649?

No, I'm still experiencing it.

@@ LITHABYS_lane_c_experience_0
Well, we both went to Hell! It wasn't a great time. I remember that
was the year you rebuilt Delsona. We both survived! I was a space
marine, and you, well, escaped.

\cn[Wait, that isn't consistent with my information, though. That
operation was canceled a month ago. Blazkowicz, their point man,
refused the mission.]

%% LITHABYS_lane_c_experience_o0
How did they cover it up a month in advance?
\cq[Something seems off here. The mission should've been public record.]

@@ LITHABYS_lane_c_coverup_0
They didn't! What are you talking about? The only cover-up that
happened was me being assigned "missing in action" after the fact!

more than shenanigans going on here.]

I don't know, guess it doesn't matter. I'll see you later, probably.

There's likely something weird going on with time. I think I should go.
