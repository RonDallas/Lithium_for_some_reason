Future..?

Alright.

Rid me of this illusion.

I will walk, with my shadow flag...

Oh, hello there. Apologies!

Hello.
\cq[Who is this..?]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_begin_o0c
Ah, hey there.
\cq[She looks cute. She reminds me of Daniel.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_begin_o0m
Ah, hey there. You look familiar.
\cq[Who is she?]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_begin_o1
Oh, sorry, didn't mean to bother you.

Oh, sorry, didn't mean to bother you.

Oh, do I? How so, might I ask? I don't believe I've met you before.

\cn[I feel intimidated by this doll.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_meet_o0
No, it must be nothing.
\cq[I'm sure it's nothing.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_meet_o1
No, just forget about it, sorry.
\cr[God damn it.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_meet_o2
No, I've definitely seen you.
\cq[What is it?]

@@ TITLEMAP_lane_m_nothing_0
Hmm... Well, whatever. Say, do you like RPG games? Also, where exactly
are we? I feel like I know *you*...

\cn[These subject hops are a bit hard to follow. I wonder if people find
me this hard to follow.]

@@ TITLEMAP_lane_m_nothing_1
Don't you hate it when they make you grind to get a 100% run? It's
just kind of mean to do that. Why not just make hidden areas?

\cn[I'm kind of perplexed. I did just finish a 100% run of an RPG
recently, and I did end up thinking that. Weird.]

\c-Anyways!

@@ TITLEMAP_lane_m_nothing_2
Strange! Were you passing into Hell, by chance? I think we might be in
some kind of precipice - a dream, perhaps!

\cn[She's surprisingly happy about this revelation.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_nothing_o0
I do like RPG games. Why?
\ct[Probably best to ignore the rest for now.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_nothing_o1
I'm not sure where we are. I just... woke up here.
\ct[I'm probably in Hell.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_nothing_o2
Why *do* we think we look alike, anyhow?
\cq[Maybe this was worth questioning.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_nothing_o3
Nevermind, you talk a mile a minute.
\cr[Not that I'm one to talk.]

@@ TITLEMAP_lane_m_seen_0
Hmm... Do you happen to have scars on your upper arms?

\cn[...What? How?]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_m_seen_o0
No.
\cr[Fuck.]

...Yes. Burn marks. Self-inflicted.

...Ah.

I'm leaving.

I see.

@@ TITLEMAP_lane_other_meet_0
Don't think I've seen you around. Say, do you come from the past? Am I
in Heaven?

\cn[I feel mildly odd about this doll.]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_other_meet_o0
I don't think Heaven exists.
\cr[What's up with that?]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_other_meet_o1
I'm not sure where I am in the first place, sorry.
\cq[Let alone what time...]

%% TITLEMAP_lane_other_meet_o2
I think I'm just going to leave.
\cr[I think that's enough.]

@@ TITLEMAP_lane_other_past_0
Neither am I... All I know about my past was that I was named Stan.
The rest seems foggy!

Alright, sorry to bother you.
